### Vulnerability Assessment

### Exploits

As an initial step, scans are run against the target machine to establish attack vectors.
```
Nmap -sV 192.168.1.105
```

![Nmap Scan1](https://github.com/OmarG13/Red-VS-Blue-Assessment-and-Hardening-of-a-Vulnerable-System/blob/main/Images/Nmap1.PNG)

```
Nmap -Pn --script vuln 192.168.1.105
```

![Nmap Scan2](https://github.com/OmarG13/Red-VS-Blue-Assessment-and-Hardening-of-a-Vulnerable-System/blob/main/Images/Nmap2.PNG)

With Apache Httpd open and Webdav showing up on our scans, it was clear the server would be accessible via a browser.
Navigating to ```192.168.1.105``` allows us to browse through the server folders where there are multiple reference to a "secret_folder" directory. There is also a list of employee names (good source for user names) as well as roles and responsibilities. All very useful in planning our attack.

![HTTP1](https://github.com/OmarG13/Red-VS-Blue-Assessment-and-Hardening-of-a-Vulnerable-System/blob/main/Images/Http1.PNG)

Navigating to the secret_folder directory requires us to use the user name and password for Ashton.

![HTTP2](https://github.com/OmarG13/Red-VS-Blue-Assessment-and-Hardening-of-a-Vulnerable-System/blob/main/Images/Http2.png)
Cracking Ashton's password is attempted using Hydra.
```
Hydra -l ashton -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -s 80 -f -vV 192.168.1.105 http-get /company_folders/sercret_folder
```
![Hydra](https://github.com/OmarG13/Red-VS-Blue-Assessment-and-Hardening-of-a-Vulnerable-System/blob/main/Images/Hydra.png)

![HTTP3](https://github.com/OmarG13/Red-VS-Blue-Assessment-and-Hardening-of-a-Vulnerable-System/blob/main/Images/Http3.png)
