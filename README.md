### Exploits
```
As an initial step, scans are run against the target machine to establish attack vectors.

Nmap -sV 192.168.1.105
```

```
Nmap -Pn --script vuln 192.168.1.105
```

```
With Apache Httpd open and Webdav showing up on our scans, it was clear the server would be accessible via a browser.
Navigating to ```192.168.1.105``` allows us to browse through the server folders where there are multiple reference to a "secret_folder" directory. There is also a list of employee names (good source for user names) as well as roles and responsibilities. All very useful in planning our attack.

```
Navigating to the secret_folder directory requires us to use the user name and password for Ashton.

```
Cracking Ashton's password is attempted using Hydra.

Hydra -l ashton -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -s 80 -f -vV 192.168.1.105 http-get /company_folders/sercret_folder
```
